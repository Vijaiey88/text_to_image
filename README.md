# Text-to-Image Generation App

Welcome to the **Text-to-Image Generation App**! This app leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to generate images based on textual descriptions. Simply enter a prompt, and the app will generate a corresponding image.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the app: [Text-to-Image App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vijaiey88/text_to_image)

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Input a text prompt, and the app will generate an image based on the description.
- **State-of-the-Art Models**: Utilizes pre-trained models for high-quality image generation.

## How to Use

1. Enter a detailed description in the input text box.
2. Click the **"Generate Image"** button.
3. Wait for a few seconds while the model processes the input and creates the image.
4. View and download the generated image.

### Example Prompts

- "A futuristic cityscape at night with neon lights."
- "A small cottage in a forest during a snowfall."
- "A cute cat wearing a wizard's hat."
- "An astronaut walking on Mars with Earth in the background."


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core logic and integration with the model are implemented in Python for seamless functionality and performance.
- **Streamlit**: The app is built using Streamlit for creating a simple and interactive user interface.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Provides hosting for this app, allowing seamless deployment and scalability.
- **Stable Diffusion**: Utilizes the popular pre-trained model for high-quality and realistic image generation.
